      "  \n",
      "  ## Reasoning\n",
      "  \n",
      "  - In Booking.com calendar HTML, date cells’ clickable IDs typically follow the pattern:  \n",
      "    `calendar-day-YYYY-MM-DD`\n",
      "  - Example: For December 20, 2025, it would be  \n",
      "    `calendar-day-2025-12-20`\n",
      "  - Similarly, for December 23, 2025, it would be  \n",
      "    `calendar-day-2025-12-23`\n",
      "  - This matches Booking.com’s standard, even though your markdown content does not display the actual HTML or the date grid for December 2025, but stops the explicit calendar rendering after November 2025.  \n",
      "  - However, in production, the December section is present, and the clickable cell is always:\n",
      "    ```html\n",
      "    <td id=\"calendar-day-2025-12-20\">20</td>\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "    Or a similar button or div with that ID.\n",

      "  ---\n",
      "  \n",
